a calculator made with test drive development approach.
I've wrote tests for the shunting yard algorithm based calculator, then implemented them.
the calculator performs 4 main opertaion (addition, subtraction, mutliplicaiton, division) 
the calculator handles negative numbers and brackets precedence.
